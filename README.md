Community powered fake news checker

## Goals

* Show latest news using NewsAPI.
* Allow users to share links to news articles on their own.
* Allow community to categorize an article as real or fake by giving credible sources.
* (In the future) Using ML to categorize an article as possibly real or possibly fake.
* Provide users to log in through Google, Twitter and Github.

## Contributing

This project uses Ruby-2.5.1 and Rails 5.2.1. So any version of Ruby and Rails that is compatible with these should be fine.

### Help needed

Help is required for writing unit tests for the code.
